# Google App Engine Fun
Google App Engine Fun (gaefun) stemmed from the CS253 Udacity course.
The course is about Web Development, not about Python. I rewrite the 
code to incorporate the knowledge I glean here and there to make it 
better with respect to Python, and good practices as I learn them.

It'll serve as a boilerplate and will live here: [https://myjugapp.appspot.com/](https://myjugapp.appspot.com/)
